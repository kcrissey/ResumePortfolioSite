Most of the technical aspects of the page should be up and working now. I fixed the pesky IE window bug, tho IE still doesn&apos;t open all of the windows to size. That I&apos;ll have to look into. But at least it is fundamentally working. A couple of Animation files need preloaders (so don&apos;t panic if there is a pause before it loads).</B></FONT></P><P ALIGN="LEFT"></P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="12" COLOR="#000000"><B>I&apos;m also going to work on adding some dynamic text fields in a few places. &nbsp;For now I&apos;m happy to just have it up and running.</B></FONT></P><P ALIGN="LEFT"></P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="12" COLOR="#000000"><B>Enjoy the site and drop me a note if you like.</B></FONT></P>Cat FaceJust a cute kitty face for amusement.Bang Zoom!... to the moon.Mother EarthNot to be trifled with.BarfurgnügenA spoof on an old VW commercial.Suspender AnimationOne of those mornings.AngelThis was used for a company Pick-An-Angel that year.AnimeA study in anime/ manga style drawing.Nagel-esqueA Nagel-like portrait done in ball-point pen.Beaver SkiingThere really is no explanation for this drawing.AbstractStudies in abstract designs.CactusA life study drawing on a cactus plant.Onion & FlowersA rendering of a cropped section of a photograph.NanaA portrait of a friend done from a photo.Human SkullAlas, poor Yorick, I knew him well.Guy PortraitA portrait of a model from a life drawing class.Girl PortraitA portrait of a girl from a life drawing class.Nude ModelA portrait of a model from a life drawing class.The MatrixAgent training simulation.Cat CrashMy first real attempt at Flash animation. This idea was partly inspired by a George Carlin comedy routine as well as real life.Droppy WalkThis basic walk-cycle came to be due to experimenting with different Flash features to begin a future animation called The Water Cycle.ChesterA short animation I had done for a nice lady realtor who really likes her dogs.Photo TouchupAfter doing a photo touchup on this photo I thought it would be amusing to animate the transformation.  Then I took it a step further.Van RemovalAnother photo touchup animation.  Not quite as elaborate as the previous.  But removing the van was interesting.Gotcha CoveredA small banner ad I designed for a local company.  Additional, enhanced version(s) may be in the making also.Sleek DesignAfter changing names, Sleek Design needed a new logo.  I designed both it and the animated logo. Thanks for the web space also Sleek!Water CycleA small-scale grandiose vision of an animated short that I'm still in the early stages of.  However, I thought sharing this incomplete beginning would be fun.BarrymoreThe outside pages of a 2-sided 11x17 real estate brochure.  Some light photo touchup work went into it also.Adams FlyerA somewhat more standard 8.5x11 color real estate flyer.  Also with some light photo touchup work.Lindsey MailerI wanted to design a mailer with a different look for this realtor team.  This idea enhanced their existing team logo.DouglasA unique take on the standard home flyer.  Less overload on specs, this flyer was intended moreso to get people to want to find out more about the home.Creative InkingA small online company that provides products with logos wanted their own logo improved and this was the final approved logo.Freelance GraphicsA logo for some of my own side/contract graphics work.  Simple and effective.The Hunt TeamThe head of this realtor team wanted a logo that had nothing to do with "hunting."  He did want the star and was very happy with this final version.Zone MapperThe highly efficient, water-conserving sprinkler system of the future! The owner saw some of my work and asked me to try a hand at re-making his logo.Team ItaliaNot all business cards need to be landscape as this portrait card for Team Italia shows.Jeri-Lin's CardJL wanted a card a little different from the cards so many other realtors have.  A stripe and monogram was the ticket.ThunderousAlthough the project never completed, I enjoyed designing this card.Sandi's CardThis was a fun card. Removed the column she was leaning on and "built" a Sold sign and added background.  She was thrilled with the results.Integrity HealthcareThis is an older card for a family friend who wanted a simple logo/card for a start-up business.Adams Mail 1The front of a bulk mail design for a couple of realtors I've done a number of projects for.Adams Mail 2And side 2 of the mailer.  These were of course addressed via merge to the printer and sent through bulk mail.Builders' Wife Magazine CoverThis was a "new look" design for this real estate team's monthly magazine mailer.Xmas DirectoryI drew the picture of course.  The other elements were done in an old version of Harvard Graphics.  High tech at that job at the time. It was then cut & paste the old-fashioned way.Crafty 'CoonsMy somewhat strange solution to a "What If?" project for school.  Are there unexplained pretzel sightings at Stonehenge?Sales FormA goodly amount of work in my career has involved creating forms for one thing or another.  So a portfolio of my work wouldn't be complete without at least one form.VoDSL FlowFlowchart design/ layout has also been a work staple. I've done flowcharting in Visio & Powerpoint, but mostly the latter.Chuck AmuckThis was a class project to design a splash page for a hero or idol.  Many of the best Warner Bros. cartoons are his creations.  Pronoun trouble. Need I say more?Samurai CouponThis was a small part of a larger job for a "door hanger" distribution by businesses in a local strip mall.Water PromoAnother class project from early in learning Photoshop.  Pick a product and design an ad for it.  What could be easier to sell than water?KrazyA study in Adobe Illustrator text effects as applied, in this case, to the letter K.ThailaAnother early Photoshop class project simply to combine various disjointed elements into a single image.Zone PanelDesign work on the user interface panel for the nice folks at Zone Mapper.--><OBJECT classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"
